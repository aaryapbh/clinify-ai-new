# Clinify.ai - Symptom Checker

Clinify.ai is a Streamlit-based symptom checker application that uses natural language processing and OpenAI to suggest possible diagnoses based on user-input symptoms.

## Project Objective

This web application allows users to:
1. Enter symptoms in free-text (natural language)
2. Get the top 3 most likely diagnoses based on the symptoms
3. Receive detailed AI-generated explanations and recommendations for each diagnosis

## How It Works

1. **Symptom Input**: Users describe their symptoms in a text area
2. **Symptom Extraction**: The app identifies known medical symptoms from the text
3. **Condition Matching**: A rule-based algorithm matches symptoms to potential conditions
4. **Diagnosis Display**: Top 3 most likely conditions are displayed as cards
5. **AI Explanation**: OpenAI (via LangChain) provides detailed explanations and next steps
